        -Exit

•   To run program : 
        just open Project "MidExam" and write command "dotnet run" in ther terminal'.


•	Reflection:
        Overall, the program is good and its cover all the important things such as Class, objects, methods , variable , collection , swich Case, inheritance , error handling ,Validation etc.
        I Guess it will be little challenging if delete item should be deleted by Quantity instead of whole item in "Delete an Individual Item".
